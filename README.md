# VisionAuth - Real-time Face Analysis System

A modern, web-based face analysis system that detects human faces and provides real-time emotion and age analysis based on facial expressions.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Uses MediaPipe for accurate face detection via webcam
- **Emotion Detection**: Detects 7 emotions (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Surprised, Angry, Confused, Disgusted)
- **Age Estimation**: Estimates approximate age based on facial features and expressions
- **Gender Recognition**: Estimates gender from facial characteristics
- **Expression Analysis**: Analyzes facial expressions in real-time
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous analysis as facial expressions change
